# Cervical_Cancer_Risk-Prediction
Cervical cancer happens when cells in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina, start to become abnormal. Small changes in the cell DNA lets them to multiply out-of-control, and cells accumulate in growths called tumors. Cervical cancer is a highly preventable but potentially deadly disease that affects the cervix. It is primarily caused by persistent infection with certain strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV).

- Cervical cancer kills about **4,000 women** in the U.S. and about **300,000 women** worldwide. Due to increased medical screening, cervical cancer death rate has been reduced by 74% from 1955 to 1992.

- Studies have shown that High sexual activity **Human papilloma virus (HPV)** is one of the key factors that increases the risk of having cervical cancer.

- Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI).Many people with HPV don't develop any symptoms but can still infect others through sexual contact. Symptoms may include warts on the genitals or surrounding skin.

- The presence of hormones in oral contraceptives, having many children, and smoking increase the risk for developing cervical cancer, particularly in women infected with HPV. Also, people with weak immune systems (HIV/AIDS) have high risk of HPV


- Regular screenings, such as Pap smears and HPV vaccines, can significantly reduce the risk of cervical cancer. Early detection and treatment are crucial for better outcomes, making awareness and preventive measures critical in the fight against this cancer.

- This dataset has around  **858 patients** observations and by building and training an **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XG-Boost)** algorithm to predict cervical cancer among those patients by the following process:-
    - Perform **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** and **Data Visualization**.
    - Prepare the data before model training.
    - Understand, Train and evaluate and **XG-Boost** model.
